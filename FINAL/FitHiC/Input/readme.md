### Hi-C significant interactions (loops)
Assigning statistical confidence estimates to intra-chromosomal contact maps produced by genome-wide genome conformation capture assays. This is incredibly important because not all of the contacts seen in the Hi-C data are truly unexpected interactions. By assigning statistical confidence to each interaction, we will be able to determine which interactions are the most important and consequently, which ones warrant further investigation.
