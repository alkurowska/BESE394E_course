# HiCFlow
### 3D chromatin conformation analysis 
Produce `.hic` and `.cool` files using our own [HiCFlow](https://github.com/Rohit-Satyam/HiCFlow/tree/main) Nextflow pipeline. The pipeline also provides the KR normalized per chromosome *_eigen.txt files, which can be used to visualize A/B compartments in the data.

### Outputs 
All outputs produced by our Nextflow pipeline are stored [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OMh9CYRXUutohMCCoLdFgclWD7HIktn7?usp=sharing)!
