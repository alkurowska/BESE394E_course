# HiCFlow
### 3D chromatin conformation analysis 
This repository provides a comprehensive Hi-C pipeline tailored for the analysis of *Plasmodium falciparum* genome.

### Outputs 
All outputs produced by our Nextflow pipeline are stored [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OMh9CYRXUutohMCCoLdFgclWD7HIktn7?usp=sharing)!
The folder contains `.hic`  and `.mcool` contact files as well as KR normalized per chromosome `*_eigen.txt` files, which can be used to visualize A/B compartments in the data.
